<template>
  <div>
    <p>We have a simple representation of dynamically managed form/data. Every step is loaded from a configuration array, and we assume, that it might differ based on configuration provided to the main component.</p>
    <p>Main component and corresponding configuration can be found under <code>@/pages/extended-forms.vue</code>.</p>
    <p>All subcomponents are located under <code>@/components/ExtendedForms</code>.</p>
    <p>The “Summary” will represent resulting data collected by the forms in individual steps.</p>
  </div>
